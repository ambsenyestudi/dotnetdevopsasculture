# Dockerize your front end

At my job we use react as our main front end technology. So, in order to see clearly 
many features of docker containers we will use react. 

## Why now dotnet?

Dotnet needs to complie to reflect changes and in this particular instance we need
to make changes while running our application.

Therefore for this example we will need node installed, npm and npx

## Process 

* Create a [new react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#:~:text=npx%20on%20the%20first%20line%20is%20not%20a,you%20don%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20know%20anything%20about%20them.) with npx
