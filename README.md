# DevOps is a culture
Looking out there I've realized that there is a lack of good DevOps tutorials focused for dotnet developers. This is my honest attempt to fill this gap.

In my professional experience there is still a misunderstanding about what DevOps means. Just in case you don't know DevOps is a word that unites Development and Operations, so if you have a DevOps department... you guessed it! you have a good old operations department.

Another thing that is out there is that a lot of developers claim that they don't like this "ops part", but since we are at the final stretch of 2021 I'm stating that this is outdated view and in the current world everybody should join the DevOps culture.
